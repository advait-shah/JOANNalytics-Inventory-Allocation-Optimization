# JOANNalytics-Inventory-Allocation-Optimization
Applied Data Processing, Machine Learning (ML) and Linear Programming (LP) in R, and Excel- Power Query and Solver:
- Tested different Linear ML models and parameters to train the best Demand prediction model having the least SSE on the test data of product's total actual demand across 3 stores in the last 3 years
- Developed tool to optimize dynamic inventory allocation across the stores from the Distribution Center (DC), using the LP optimization such that it reduces shortages, excess holding and markdown at stores, and maximizes product revenue
