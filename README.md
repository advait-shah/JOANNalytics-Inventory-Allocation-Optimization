# JOANNalytics-Inventory-Allocation-Optimization
Applied Data processing, ML and Linear programming in R, and Excel- Power Query and solver

- Tested different ML models and parameters to achieve best Demand prediction model with least SSE on the test data of product's total demand across 3 stores in the last 2 years
- Developed tool to optimize dynamic inventory allocation across stores from DC, using linear programming optimization such that it reduces shortages, excess holding and markdown at stores, and maximizes product revenue
